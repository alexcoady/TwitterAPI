## Installation

I tried to keep this project as simple as possible, the only build tools included (grunt) are to compile the template files for the application.

1. Clone this repo
2. Add site to XAMPP/MAMP/ other local php stack
3. Open site and enter screen names to interact

## Making changes
If you change the template files, they will need to be recompiled

Run `grunt jst` and reload the project in your browser
